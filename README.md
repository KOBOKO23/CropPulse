# CropPulse - Agrometeorological Data Digitization Platform

## Overview

CropPulse is a digital platform designed to transform agrometeorological data collection in Kenya. Built with a modern tech stack—**Python, Django, HTML, CSS, and React**—the platform digitizes key phenological and environmental monitoring forms used at agromet stations. CropPulse replaces manual processes that rely on WhatsApp image sharing and paper-based courier systems with structured, real-time data submission.

## Purpose

The aim of CropPulse is to:

* Digitize core agrometeorological forms
* Enable instant, error-reduced data capture
* Facilitate timely submission to headquarters for analysis
* Improve data quality and integrity
* Enhance decision-making for food security planning

## Key Features

* **Form Digitization:** All major agrometeorological reporting forms digitized
* **Offline Capability:** Collect data in rural areas with limited connectivity
* **Real-time Submission:** Enables quicker data transfer and verification
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for field officers with minimal training needs
* **Data Visualization:** Supports trend analysis and bulletin creation

## Digitized Forms (Initial Phase)

1. **Agro-1 Form:** Monthly phenological report for annual crops
2. **Agro-2 Form:** Monthly phenological report for perennial crops
3. **Agro-3 Form:** Monthly phenological report for perennial plants without seasonal pattern
4. **Agro-4 Form:** Ten-day agrometeorological report (crop state & yield)
5. **Agro-5 Form:** Soil moisture status
6. **Agro-6 Form:** Soil temperature monthly report
7. **Agro-7 Form:** Pedat (5-day average soil conditions)
8. **Agro-18 Form:** Decade weather and crop reports
9. **Agro-19 Form:** Agrometeorological data for crop monitoring in sub-counties

## Technical Stack

* **Backend:** Python, Django
* **Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS
* **Database:** To be defined (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL)

## Benefits to Food Security and Data Management

* **Improved Data Accuracy:** Reduces transcription and interpretation errors
* **Faster Bulletin Production:** Streamlined form submission and aggregation
* **Enhanced Forecasting:** Reliable data supports better planning for pests, drought, and yield
* **Historical Data Access:** Enables long-term trend analysis
* **Policy Support:** Better-informed interventions for national food security
* **Scalability:** Potential for integration with global systems (e.g., Climsoft, CDT)

## Future Roadmap

* Integration with other meteorological and climate databases
* Push alerts for extreme weather and pests
* Predictive analytics using AI/ML
* Multilingual and mobile-first design for rural outreach

## Acknowledgement

This app is purposely developed to fulfill my Operational Training Course objective as a review of efforts in the **Digitization Of Agrometeorological Data In Kenya: A Case Study Of The CropPulse App**.

Special acknowledgment to all the instructors who contributed to the fulfillment of the course—especially **Mr. Kimonye**, who introduced me to the fundamentals of agrometeorology and provided invaluable guidance throughout the project.

This project aligns with national and international frameworks focused on climate action, zero hunger, and agricultural innovation. CropPulse serves as a practical tool for agricultural resilience and public service digitalization.
